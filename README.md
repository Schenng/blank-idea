# Introduction #

This repo serves as my general purpose "Oh this is a great idea, we should make it" starter. 
You never know what the next idea will be, but you may as well be ready for it.

## Web Frontend ##

- create-react-app-2 (w/ typescript)
  - axios (promise based HTTP client)
  - redux (application level state)
  - react-router (routing)
  - http-proxy-middleware (allows custom url proxies)
  - typescript (javascript that scales)
  - ESLint (force code cleanliness)
  - palantir redoodle (typed actions which flow to reducers)

## Backend ##
